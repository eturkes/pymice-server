# PyMICE Server
#### *This project is a work-in-progress*

PyMICE Server has a similar workflow and functionality to PyMICE Analyzer but utilizes
Wooey (https://github.com/wooey/Wooey) to create a Django-based web UI. A noteworthy
advantage is that it is easily configured so that jobs are submitted to local or cloud
servers for centralized, high-throughput analysis. For laboratories interesting in
applying techniques with high hardware demands like machine learning, this may be a
useful tool.
